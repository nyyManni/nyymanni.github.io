Welcome to www.nyymanni.com

This web page tells the story of my life.

As it might be obvious from the style of this website, my tool of choice is GNU
Emacs. I also get along with Vim-folks, since I prefer vim-style keybindings and
use evil-mode. I am highly allergic to IDEs and tools that hide complexity and
remove control. I am a Linux-user and prefer working with a tiling window manager
(currently using Sway).

I like to work on low-level stuff with C(++), and high-level stuff in Python, and
also love Lisp. Web development is not the greatest passion of mine, allthough I
did manage to pull off this website.

On my free time I like to work on my open source "rojekti"s, which are in various
states of completeness. Those can be found on my Github page at
https://github.com/nyyManni. I also like to play with networking and server
software at my home network (ask my wife how many times our networking has
changed for "no obvious reason").
